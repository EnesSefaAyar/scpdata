\description{
They demonstrate the correlations between the levels of pairs of proteins
in single-cell proteomics (SCP) at steady state. In measuring pairwise
correlations among 1000 proteins in a population of K562 cells and oocytes,
they observed many correlated protein modules (CPMs) that are functionally
involved in certain biological functions. Certain CPMs are specific to a
particular cell type, some common to different cell types. Additionally,
compared to single-cell transcriptomics and bulk proteomics,
protein correlations are functionally and experimentally more significant
in SCP than those corresponding mRNAs.

\section{Acquisition protocol}{


The data were acquired using the following setup. More information
can be found in the source article (see \code{References}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cell isolation}: K562 cells were re-suspended and washed in cold PBS.
Single cells/10 cells were sorted into 96-well plates using a FACSAria
instrument. Oocyte-cumulus complexes from C57/6J mice were collected
after PMSG and HCG injections, with hyaluronidase used to remove cumulus
cells. All samples stored at -80 degrees Celsius.
\item \strong{Sample preparation} Cells were digested with trypsin at 37 degrees
Celsius for 3 hours. For label-free proteomics, digestion was terminated
by adding 0.43\% TFA and 1\% ACN in water, followed by drying in a
concentrator. Peptides were resuspended in 0.1\% TFA and 1\% ACN, and
then transferred to sample tubes for LC-MS/MS analysis.
\item \strong{Separation}: 4 microliters of peptide digests were injected into a
high-performance chromatography column (IonOpticks) and separated at a
flow rate of 100 nL/min using a nanoflow liquid chromatography system.
The effective gradient was 70 mins, allowing 16 cells per day.
\item \strong{Ionization}: Peptides were analyzed using an Orbitrap Eclipse mass
spectrometer with a FAIMS Pro interface. FAIMS compensation voltages of
−55 and −70 V were applied, with a 1-second cycle time for both voltages.
\item \strong{Mass spectrometry}: MS spectra were acquired with the Orbitrap
analyzer, while MS/MS spectra were acquired with a linear ion trap
analyzer. The maximum ion injection time for MS/MS was 200 ms.
\item \strong{Data analysis}: MS raw files were searched against the UniProt
human protein database and an in-house contamination database
using Proteome Discoverer(2.4). Label-free quantification was based on
peak intensity with the match-between-runs (MBR) feature enabled.

\section{Data collection}{


The oocyte protein data shared by the author and it is accessible from the
\href{https://biopic-my.sharepoint.cn/:x:/g/personal/humo_biopic_pku_edu_cn/EfX4CHedVopLuSx2OJNj6LABdESGNdKz4Eh8Zawvd-fNNQ?e=E5m09k&xsdata=MDV8MDJ8ZW5lcy5heWFyQHVjbG91dmFpbi5iZXxjYjY2M2MwYzNjMDY0YjZhNjc1NTA4ZGM4YzMzNjc1YXw3YWIwOTBkNGZhMmU0ZWNmYmM3YzQxMjdiNGQ1ODJlY3wxfDB8NjM4NTM5Mzk5NjI1Mzg1NDQ3fFVua25vd258VFdGcGJHWnNiM2Q4ZXlKV0lqb2lNQzR3TGpBd01EQWlMQ0pRSWpvaVYybHVNeklpTENKQlRpSTZJazFoYVd3aUxDSlhWQ0k2TW4wPXwwfHx8&sdata=Zmt4YnZFZFViTitJRkdTc0FTK2thMjdTT0EzV2JJeS83WlZmV3R6SzdvRT0\%3d}{Shared File}
The K563 protein data is accessible from the
\link{GitHub} https://github.com/dionezhang/CPM/blob/master/ProteinAbundance.Rdata
\itemize{
\item \verb{DataMatrix-oocyte-20240614.csv}: normalized imputed protein matrix
\item \code{ProteinAbundance.Rdata}: protein matrices (normalized, log transformed)
}

We initialized an empty QFeatures object and added the corresponding
protein assays as \link{SingleCellExperiment} objects.

The oocyte protein data were exported from the shared link as
(\verb{DataMatrix-oocyte-20240614.csv}). The data were formatted to a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object and the SampleType information were added
as only metadata, and stored in the \code{colData}. The object is then added
to the \link{QFeatures} object.

The 562 cells protein data were downloaded from the GitHub link and loaded
to the memory. The \code{Norm} object were formatted to a \link{SingleCellExperiment}
object and the SampleType information were added as only metadata, and
stored in the \code{colData}. The object is then added to the \link{QFeatures} object.
