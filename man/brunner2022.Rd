\title{Brunner et al. 2022 (Mol. Syst. Biol.): cell cycle state study}
\format{
A \link{QFeatures} object with 435 assays, each assay being a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object.
\itemize{
\item Assay 1-434: DIA-NN main output report table split for each
acquisition run. Since each run acquires 1 single cell, each
assay contains a single column. It contains the results
of the spectrum identification and quantification.
\item \code{protein}: DIA-NN protein group matrix, containing normalised
quantities for 2476 protein groups in 434 single cells. Proteins
are filtered at 1\% FDR, using global q-values for protein groups
and both global and run-specific q-values for precursors.
}

The \code{colData(brunner2022())} contains cell type annotations and
batch annotations. The description of the \code{rowData} fields for the
different assays can be found in the
\href{https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN#readme}{\code{DIA-NN} documentation}.

\description{
Single cell proteomics data acquired by the Mann Lab using a newly
designed timsTOF instrument, referred to as timsTOF-SCP. The
dataset contains quantitative information from single-cells blocked
at 4 cell cycle stages: G1, G1-S, G2, G2-M. The data was acquired
using a label-free sample preparation protocole combined to a
data independent (DIA) acquisition mode.
}
\section{Acquisition protocol}{


The data were acquired using the following setup. More information
can be found in the source article (see \code{References}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cell isolation}: cells were detached with trypsin treatment,
followed by strong pipetting, and isolate using FACS.
\item \strong{Sample preparation}: cell lysis by freeze-heat followed by
sonication, overnight protein digestion with trypsin/lysC mix and
desalting using EvoTips trap column (EvoSep)
\item \strong{Separation}: online EvoSep One LC system using a 5 cm x 75 µm
ID column with 1.9µm C18 beads (EvoSep) at 100nL/min flow rate.
\item \strong{Ionization}: 10µm ID zero dead volume electrospray emitter
(Bruker Daltonik) + nanoelectro-spray ion source (Captive spray,
Bruker Daltonik)
\item \strong{Mass spectrometry}: DIA PASEF mode. Correlation between IM
and m/z was used to synchronize the elution of precursors from
each IM scan with the quadrupole isolation window. Five
consecutive diaPASEF cycles. The collision energy was ramped
linearly as a function of the IM from 59 eV at 1/K0=1.6 Vs cm^2
to 20 eV at 1/K0=0.6 Vs cm^2.
\item \strong{Data analysis}: DIA-NN (1.8).

\section{Data collection}{


The data were collected from the PRIDE
\href{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD024043}{repository}
in the \code{DIANN1.8_SingleCells_CellCycle.zip} file.

We loaded the DIA-NN main report table and generated a sample
annotation table based on the MS file names. We next combined the
sample annotation and the DIANN tables into a \link{QFeatures} object
following the \code{scp} data structure. We loaded the proteins group
matrix as a \link{SingleCellExperiment} object, fixed ambiguous
protein group names, and added the protein data as a new assay and
link the precursors to proteins using the \code{Protein.Group} variable
from the \code{rowData}.
