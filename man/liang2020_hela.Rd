\title{Liang et al. 2020 (Anal. Chem.): HeLa cells (MaxQuant preprocessing)}
\format{
A \link{QFeatures} object with 17 assays, each assay being a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object:
\itemize{
\item \verb{HeLa_*}: 15 assays containing PSM data.
\item \code{peptides}: quantitative data for 48705 peptides in 15 samples
(all runs are combined).
\item \code{proteins}: quantitative data for 3970 protein groups in 15
samples (all runs combined).
}

Sample annotation is stored in \code{colData(liang2020_hela())}.

\source{
The PSM data can be downloaded from the PRIDE repository
PXD021882 The source link is:

\description{
Single-cell proteomics data from HeLa cells using the autoPOTS
acquisition workflow. The samples contain either no cells (blanks),
1 cell, 10 cells, 150 cells or 500 cells. Samples containing
between 0 and 10 cells are isolated using micro-pipetting while
samples containing between 150 and 500 cells were prepared using
dilution of a bulk sample.
}
\section{Acquisition protocol}{


The data were acquired using the following setup. More information
can be found in the source article (see \code{References}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cell isolation}: The HeLa cells come from a commercially
available cell line. Samples containing between 0 and 10 cells
were isolated using micro-manipulation and the counts were
validated using a microscope. Samples containing between 150 and
500 cells were prepared by diluting a bulk sample and the exact
counts were evaluated by obtaining phtotmicrographs.
\item \strong{Sample preparation} performed using the autoPOTS worflow that
relied on the OT-2 pipeting robot. Cell are lysed using
sonication. Samples are then processed by successive incubation
with DTT (reduction), then IAA (alkylation), then Lys-C and
trypsin (protein digestion).
\item \strong{Separation}: Samples were injected on the column using a
modified Ultimate WPS-3000 TPL autosampler coupled to an UltiMate
3000 RSLCnano pump. The LC column is a home-packed nanoLC column
(45cm x 30um; 40nL/min)
\item \strong{Ionization}: Nanospray Flex ion source (2,000V)
\item \strong{Mass spectrometry}: Orbitrap Exploris 480. MS1 settings:
accumulation time = 250 ms (0-10 cells) or 100 ms (150-500 cells);
resolution = 120,000; AGC = 100\\%. MS2 settings: exlusion
duration = 90 s (0-10 cells) or 60 s (150-500 cells) ; accumulation
time = 500 ms (0-1 cell), 250 ms (10 cells), 100 ms (150 cells)
or 50 ms (500 cells); resolution = 60,000 (0-10 cells) or 30,000
(150-500 cells); AGC = 5E3 (0-1 cells) or 1E4 (10-500 cells).
\item \strong{Data analysis}: MaxQuant (v1.6.7.0) and the search database
is Swiss-Prot (July 2020).

\section{Data collection}{


All data were collected from the PRIDE repository (accession ID:
PXD021882).

The sample annotations were collected from the methods section and
from table S3 in the paper.

The PSM data were found in the \code{evidence.txt} file. The data were
converted to a \link{QFeatures} object using the \link[scp:readSCP]{scp::readSCP}
function.

The peptide data were found in the \code{peptides.txt} file. The column
names holding the quantitative data were adapted to match the
sample names in the \link{QFeatures} object. The data were then
converted to a \link{SingleCellExperiment} object and then inserted in
the \link{QFeatures} object. Links between the PSMs and the peptides
were added

A similar procedure was applied to the protein data. The data were
found in the \code{proteinGroups.txt} file. The column names were
adapted, the data were converted to a \link{SingleCellExperiment}
object and then inserted in the \link{QFeatures} object. Links between
the peptides and the proteins were added
