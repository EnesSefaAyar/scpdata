\title{Zhu et al. 2018 (Nat. Comm.): human pancreatic islets}
\format{
A \link{QFeatures} object with 4 assays, each assay being a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object:
\itemize{
\item \code{peptides}: quantitative information for 24,321 peptides from
18 islet samples
\item \code{proteins_intensity}: quantitative information for 3,278
proteins from 18 islet samples
\item \code{proteins_LFQ}: LFQ intensities for 3,278 proteins from 18 islet
samples
\item \code{proteins_iBAQ}: iBAQ values for 3,278 proteins from 18 islet
samples
}

Sample annotation is stored in \code{colData(zhu2018NC_islets())}.
}
\source{
The PSM data can be downloaded from the PRIDE repository
PXD006847. The source link is:

}
\description{
Near single-cell proteomics data human pancreas samples. The
samples were collected from pancreatic tissue slices using laser
dissection. The pancreata were obtained from organ donors through
the JDRFNetwork for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD)
program. The sample come either from control patients (n=9) or
from type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients (n=9).
}
\section{Acquisition protocol}{


The data were acquired using the following setup. More information
can be found in the source article (see \code{References}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cell isolation}: The islets were extracted from the pacreatic
tissues using laser-capture microdissection.
\item \strong{Sample preparation} performed using the nanoPOTs device.
Protein extraction using RapiGest (+ DTT) + alkylation (IAA) +
Lys-C digestion + cleave RapiGest (formic acid)
\item \strong{Separation}: nanoACQUITY UPLC pump with an Self-Pack PicoFrit
70cm x 30um LC columns; 60nL/min)
\item \strong{Ionization}: ESI (1,900V)
\item \strong{Mass spectrometry}: Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Fusion Lumos
Tribrid. MS1 settings: accumulation time = 246ms; resolution =
120,000; AGC = 1E6. MS/MS settings: accumulation time = 118ms;
resolution = 60,000; AGC = 1E5.
\item \strong{Data analysis}: MaxQuant (v1.5.3.30) + Perseus + OriginLab

\section{Data collection}{


The data were collected from the PRIDE repository (accession
ID: PXD006847).  We downloaded the \code{Islet_t1d_ct_peptides.txt}
and the \code{Islet_t1d_ct_proteinGroups.txt} files containing the
combined identification and quantification results. The sample
types were inferred from the names of columns holding the
quantification data. The peptides data were converted to a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object. We split the protein table to
separate the three types of quantification: protein intensity,
label-free quantitification (LFQ) and intensity based absolute
quantification (iBAQ). Each table is converted to a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object along with the remaining protein
annotations. The 4 objects are combined in a single \link{QFeatures}
object and feature links are created based on the peptide leading
razor protein ID and the protein ID.
