\description{
Single-cell proteomics using nanoPOTS combined with TMT isobaric labeling. 
The cell types are either "Raw" (macrophage cells), "C10" 
(epihelial cells), or "SVEC" (endothelial cells). Each cell is replicated 2 
or 3x. Each cell type was run using 3 levels of boosting: 0 ng (no boosting), 
5 ng or 50 ng. When boosting was applied, 1 reference well and 1 boosting 
well were added, otherwise 1 empty well was added. Each boosting setting 
(no boosting, 5ng, 50ng) was run twice.

The data set is published as the supplementary data set 2 by Dou et al. in 
2019 (see references). The expression matrix contains 1436 proteins x 60 
single cells. The spreadsheet is called \code{ac9b03349_si_004.xlsx} and contains 7 sheets 
from which we took the 2nd, 4th and 6th sheets (named \code{"01 - No Boost 
raw data"}, \code{"03 - 5ng boost raw data"}, \code{"05 - 50ng boost raw 
data"}, respectively). It corresponds to the assembly of MSGF+ 
identifications and MASIC reporter assemblies. The data is then isotope 
corrected and sum rolled-up to the protein level. Contaminant and reverse hit 
are removed from this table. This is all performed by the authors. We matched 
the proteins between the three boosting settings and combined all data in a 
single table. The boosting quantities are kept as phenotype data. The data 
set is formated to an \code{\link{SingleCellExperiment}} object.
