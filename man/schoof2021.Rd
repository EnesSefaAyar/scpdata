\format{
A \link{QFeatures} object with 194 assays, each assay being a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object:
\itemize{
\item \verb{F*}: 192 assays containing PSM quantification data for 16
TMT channels. The quantification data contain signal to noise
ratios as computed by Proteome Discoverer.
\item \code{proteins}: quantitative data for 2898 protein groups in 3072
samples (all runs combined). The quantification data contain
signal to noise ratios as computed by Proteome Discoverer.
\item \code{logNormProteins}: quantitative data for 2723 protein groups in
2025 single-cell samples. This assay is the protein datasets that
was processed by the authors. Dimension reduction and clustering
data are also available in the \code{reducedDims} and \code{colData} slots,
respectively
}

Sample annotation is stored in \code{colData(schoof2021())}. The cell
type annotation is stored in the \code{Population} column. The flow
cytometry data is also available: FSC-A, FSC-H, FSC-W, SSC-A,
SSC-H, SSC-W, APC-Cy7-A (= CD34) and PE-A (= CD38).

\description{
Single-cell proteomics data from OCI-AML8227 cell culture to
reconstruct the cellular hierarchy. The data were acquired using
TMTpro multiplexing. The samples contain either no cells,
single cells, 10 cells (reference channel) 200 cells (booster
channel) or are simply empty wells. Single cells are expected to
be one of progenitor cells (\code{PROG}), leukaemia stem cells (\code{LSC}),
CD38- blast cells (\verb{BLAST CD38-}) or CD38+ blast cells
(\verb{BLAST CD38+}). Booster are either a known 1:1:1 mix of cells
(PROG, LSC and BLAST) or are isolated directly from the bulk
sample. Samples were isolated and annotated using flow cytometry.

\section{Acquisition protocol}{


The data were acquired using the following setup. More information
can be found in the source article (see \code{References}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Sample isolation}: cultured AML 8227 cells were stained with
anti-CD34 and anti-CD38. The sorting was performed by FACSAria
instrument and deposited in 384 well plates.
\item \strong{Sample preparation}: cells are lysed using freeze-boil and
sonication in a lysis buffer (TFE) that also includes reduction
and alkylation reagents (TCEP and CAA), followed by trypsin
(protein) and benzonase (DNA) digestion, TMT-16 labeling and
quenching, desalting using SOLAµ C18 plate, peptide
concentration, pooling and peptide concentration again. The
booster channel contains 200 cell equivalents.
\item \strong{Liquid chromatography}: peptides are separated using a C18
reverse-phase column (50cm x 75 µm i.d., Thermo EasySpray) combined
to a Thermo EasyLC 1200 for 160 minute gradient with a flowrate of
100nl/min.
\item \strong{Mass spectrometry}: FAIMSPro interface is used. MS1 setup:
resolution 60.000, AGC target of 300\%, accumulation of 50ms. MS2
setup: resolution 45.000, AGC target of 150, 300 or 500\%,
accumulation of 150, 300, 500, or 1000ms.
\item \strong{Raw data processing}: Proteome Discoverer 2.4 + Sequest spectral
search engine and validation with Percolator

\section{Data collection}{


All data were collected from the PRIDE repository (accession ID:
PXD020586). The data and metadata were extracted from the
\code{SCeptre_FINAL.zip} file.

We performed extensive data wrangling to combine al the metadata
available from different files into a single table available using
\code{colData(schoof2021)}.

The PSM data were found in the \code{bulk_PSMs.txt} file. Contaminants
were defined based on the protein accessions listed in
\code{contaminant.txt}. The data were converted to a \link{QFeatures}
object using the \link[scp:readSCP]{scp::readSCP} function.

The protein data were found in the \code{bulk_Proteins.txt} file.
Contaminants were defined based on the protein accessions listed
in \code{contaminant.txt}.The column names holding the quantitative
data were adapted to match the sample names in the \link{QFeatures}
object. Unnecessary feature annotations (such as in which assay
a protein is found) were removed. Feature names were created
following the procedure in SCeptre: features names are the
protein symbol (or accession if missing) and if duplicated
symbols are present (protein isoforms), they are made unique by
appending the protein accession.  Contaminants were defined based
on the protein accessions listed in \code{contaminant.txt}. The data
were then converted to a \link{SingleCellExperiment} object and
inserted in the \link{QFeatures} object.

The log-normalized protein data were found in the \code{bulk.h5ad} file.
This dataset was generated by the authors by running the notebook
called \code{bulk.ipynb}. The \code{bulk.h5ad} was loaded as an \code{AnnData}
object using the \code{scanpy} Python module. The object was then
converted to a \code{SingleCellExperiment} object using the
\code{zellkonverter} package. The column names holding the quantitative
data were adapted to match the sample names in the \link{QFeatures}
object. The data were then inserted in the \link{QFeatures} object.

The script to reproduce the \code{QFeatures} object is available at
\code{system.file("scripts", "make-data_schoof2021.R", package = "scpdata")}
