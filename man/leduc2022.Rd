\title{Leduc et al. 2022 - SCoPE2 (biorRxiv): melanoma cells vs monocytes}
\format{
A \link{QFeatures} object with 138 assays, each assay being a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object:
\itemize{
\item Assay 1-134: PSM data acquired with a TMT-18plex protocol, hence
those assays contain 18 columns. Columns hold quantitative
information from single-cell channels, carrier channels,
reference channels, empty (negative control) channels and
unused channels.
\item \code{peptides}: peptide data containing quantitative data for 20,804
peptides and 1556 single-cells. These data have been filtered
to keep high-quality PSMs, all batches have been normalized to
the reference channel, PSMs were aggregated to peptides, and
single-cells with low median coefficient of variation were kept.
\item \code{peptides_log}: peptide data containing quantitative data for
12,284 peptides and 1543 single-cells. The \code{peptides} data was
further normalized, highly missing peptides were removed and the
quantifications were log-transformed.
\item \code{proteins_norm2}: protein data containing quantitative data for
2844 proteins and 1543 single-cells. The peptides from
\code{peptides_log} were aggregated to proteins and normalized.
\item \code{proteins_processed}: protein data containing quantitative data
for 2844 proteins and 1543 single-cells. The \code{proteins_norm2}
data were imputed, batch corrected and normalized.
}

The \code{colData(leduc2022())} contains cell type annotation and
batch annotation that are common to all assays. The description of
the \code{rowData} fields for the PSM data can be found in the
\href{http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:table:evidencetable}{\code{MaxQuant} documentation}.

The data were downloaded from the
\href{https://scp.slavovlab.net/Leduc_et_al_2022}{Slavov Lab} website.
The raw data and the quantification data can also be found in the
massIVE repository \code{MSV000089159}:

\description{
Single cell proteomics data acquired by the Slavov Lab. This is
the dataset associated to the third version of the preprint. It
contains quantitative information of melanoma cells and monocytes
at PSM, peptide and protein level.
}
\section{Acquisition protocol}{


The data were acquired using the following setup. More information
can be found in the source article (see \code{References}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cell isolation}: CellenONE cell sorting.
\item \strong{Sample preparation} performed using the improved SCoPE2
protocol using the CellenONE liquid handling system. nPOP cell
lysis (DMSO) + trypsin digestion + TMT-18plex
labeling and pooling. A target library was generated as well to
perform prioritized DDA (Huffman et al. 2022) using MaxQuant.Live
(2.0.3).
\item \strong{Separation}: online nLC (DionexUltiMate 3000 UHPLC with a
25cm x 75um IonOpticks Aurora Series UHPLC column; 200nL/min).
\item \strong{Ionization}: ESI (1,800V).
\item \strong{Mass spectrometry}: Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive (MS1
resolution = 70,000; MS2 accumulation time = 300ms; MS2
resolution = 70,000).
\item \strong{Data analysis}: MaxQuant (1.6.17.0) + DART-ID
}
}

\section{Data collection}{


The PSM data were collected from a shared Google Drive folder that
is accessible from the SlavovLab website (see \code{Source} section).
The folder contains the following files of interest:
\itemize{
\item \code{ev_updated.txt}: the MaxQuant/DART-ID output file
\item \code{annotation.csv}: sample annotation
\item \code{batch.csv}: batch annotation
\item \code{t0.csv}: the processed data table containing the \code{peptides} data
\item \code{t3.csv}: the processed data table containing the \code{peptides_log}
data
\item \code{t4b.csv}: the processed data table containing the
\code{proteins_norm2} data
\item \code{t6.csv}: the processed data table containing the
\code{proteins_processed} data
}

We combined the the sample annotation and the batch annotation in
a single table. We also formated the quantification table so that
columns match with those of the annotations. Both annotation and
quantification tables are then combined in a single \link{QFeatures}
object using the \link[scp:readSCP]{scp::readSCP} function.

The 4 CSV files were loaded and formated as \link{SingleCellExperiment}
objects and the sample metadata were matched to the column names
(mapping is retrieved after running the author's original R script)
and stored in the \code{colData}.
The object is then added to the \link{QFeatures} object (containing the
PSM assays) and the rows of the peptide data are linked to the
rows of the PSM data based on the peptide sequence information
through an \code{AssayLink} object.
