\format{
A \link{QFeatures} object with 4 assays, each assay being a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object:
\itemize{
\item \code{peptides}: quantitative information for 13,055 peptides from
24 samples
\item \code{proteins_intensity}: protein intensities for 2,257 proteins
from 24 samples
\item \code{proteins_LFQ}: LFQ intensities for 2,257 proteins from 24 samples
\item \code{proteins_iBAQ}: iBAQ values for 2,257 proteins from 24 samples
}

Sample annotation is stored in \code{colData(zhu2018MCP())}.

\description{
Near single-cell proteomics data of laser captured
micro-dissection samples. The samples are 24 brain sections from
rat pups (day 17). The slices are 12 um thick squares of either
50, 100, or 200 um width. 5 samples were dissected from the corpus
callum (\code{CC}), 4 samples were dissected from the corpus collosum
(\code{CP}), 13 samples were extracted from the cerebral cortex
(\code{CTX}), and 2 samples are labeled as (\code{Mix}).
}
\section{Acquisition protocol}{


The data were acquired using the following setup. More information
can be found in the original article (see \code{References}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cell isolation}: brain patches were collected using
laser-capture microdissection (PALM MicroBeam) on flash frozen
rat (\emph{Rattus norvergicus}) brain tissues. Note that the samples
were stained with H&E before dissection for histological
analysis. DMSO is used as sample collection solution
\item \strong{Sample preparation} performed using the nanoPOTs device: DMSO
evaporation + protein extraction (DMM + DTT) + alkylation (IAA)
\itemize{
\item Lys-C digestion + trypsin digestion.
}
\item \strong{Separation}: nanoLC (Dionex UltiMate with an in-house packed
60cm x 30um LC columns; 50nL/min)
\item \strong{Ionization}: ESI (2,000V)
\item \strong{Mass spectrometry}: Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Fusion Lumos
Tribrid (MS1 accumulation time = 246ms; MS1 resolution =
120,000; MS1 AGC = 3E6). The MS/MS settings  depend on the
sample size, excepted for the AGC = 1E5. 50um (time = 502ms;
resolution = 240,000), 100um (time = 246ms; resolution =
120,000), 200um (time = 118ms; resolution = 60,000).
\item \strong{Data analysis}: MaxQuant (v1.5.3.30) + Perseus (v1.5.6.0) +
Origin Pro 2017
}
}

\section{Data collection}{


The data were collected from the PRIDE repository (accession
ID: PXD008844).  We downloaded the \code{MaxQuant_Peptides.txt}
and the \code{MaxQuant_ProteinGroups.txt} files containing the
combined identification and quantification
results. The sample annotations were inferred from the names of
columns holding the quantification data and the information in the
article. The peptides data were converted to a \link{SingleCellExperiment}
object. We split the protein table to separate the three types of
quantification: protein intensity, label-free quantitification
(LFQ) and intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ). Each
table is converted to a \link{SingleCellExperiment} object along with
the remaining protein annotations. The 4 objects are combined in
a single \link{QFeatures} object and feature links are created based on
the peptide leading razor protein ID and the protein ID.
