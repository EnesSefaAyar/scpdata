\title{Woo et al. 2022 (Cell Syst.): LPS-treated macrophages}
\format{
A \link{QFeatures} object with 5 assays, each assay being a
\link{SingleCellExperiment} object:
\itemize{
\item \verb{peptides_[intensity or LFQ]}: 2 assays containing peptide
quantities or normalized quantities using the maxLFQ method
as computed by MaxQuant.
\item \verb{proteins_[intensity or iBAQ or LFQ]}: 3 assays containing
protein quantities or normalized proteins using the iBAQ or
maxLFQ methods as computed by MaxQuant.
}

Sample annotation is stored in \code{colData(woo_macrophage())}.
}
\source{
The peptide and protein data can be downloaded from the MASSIVE
repository MSV000085937

\description{
Single-cell data from macrophages subjected to 3 LPS
treatments. The data were
acquired using the TIFF (transfer identification based on FAIMS
filtering) acquisition method. The data contain 155 single cells:
54 control cells (no treatment), 52 cells treated with LPS during
24h and 49 cells treated with LPS during 49h.
}
\section{Acquisition protocol}{


The data were acquired using the following setup. More information
can be found in the source article (see \code{References}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Sample isolation}: cultured RAW 264.7 cells treated or not
with 100 ng/ul LPS. The cells were sorted using the Influx II
cell sorter and deposited on a nanoPOTS chip.
\item \strong{Sample preparation}: cells are lysed using using a DDM+DTT
lysis and reduction buffer. The proteins are alkylated with IAA
and digested with LysC and trypsin. Samples are then acidified
with FA, vacuum dried and stored in freezer until data
acquisition.
\item \strong{Liquid chromatography}: peptides are loaded using an in-house
autosampler (Williams et al. 2020). The samples are concentrated
through a SPE column (4cm x 100µm i.d. packed with 5µm C18) with
microflow LC pump. The peptides are then eluted from an LC
column (25cm x 50 µm i.d. packed with 1.7µm C18) from a 60 min
gradient (100nL/min).
\item \strong{Mass spectrometry}: MS/MS was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion
Lumos Tribrid MS with FAIMSpro coupled to a 2.4 kV ESI. FAIMS
setup: 4-CV method (-45, -55, -65, -75 V). MS1 setup: resolution
= 120.000, range = 350-1500 m/z,AGC target of 1E6, accumulation
of 254ms. MS2 setup: 30\% HCD, resolution AGC 2E4, accumulation
of 254ms.
\item \strong{Raw data processing}: preprocessing using Maxquant v1.6.2.10
that use Andromeda search engine (with UniProtKB 2016-21-29).
MBR was enabled.

\section{Data collection}{


All data were collected from the MASSIVE repository (accession ID:
MSV000085937).

The peptide and protein data were extracted from the
\code{peptides_RAW_LPS_scProteomics.txt} or
\code{proteinGroups_RAW_LPS_scProteomics.txt} files, respectively, in
the \code{RAW_LPS_SingleCellProteomics} folders.

The tables were split so that intensities, maxLFQ, and iBAQ
data are contained in separate tables. Tables are then
converted to \link{SingleCellExperiment} objects. Sample annotations
were inferred from the sample names. All data is combined in
a \link{QFeatures} object. \link{AssayLinks} were stored between peptide
assays and their corresponding proteins assays based on the
leading razor protein (hence only unique peptides are linked to
proteins).

The script to reproduce the \code{QFeatures} object is available at
\code{system.file("scripts", "make-data_woo2022_macrophage.R", package = "scpdata")}
